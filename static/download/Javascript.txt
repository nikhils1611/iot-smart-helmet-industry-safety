JavaScript is one of the most-used programming languages.According to Northeastern University, it’s the second-most popular coding language out there.Clearly,JavaScript
is an integral part of our daily online lives.But what is JavaScript exactly and what can you use it for Together with HTML and CSS,JavaScript is one of the three core
components of the internet. Any website you visit is bound to use a combination of these three programming languages, each with its own particular purpose. Let’s have 
a look at them in more detail.

JavaScript typically relies on a run-time environment (e.g., a web browser) to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the environment 
(e.g., a web page DOM). These environments are single-threaded. JavaScript also relies on the run-time environment to provide the ability to include/import scripts
(e.g., HTML <script> elements).This is not a language feature per se, but it is common in most JavaScript implementations. JavaScript processes messages from a queue 
one at a time. JavaScript calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call 
stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. 
This is called the event loop, described as"run to completion" because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's
concurrency model describes the event loop as non-blocking:program input/output is performed using events and callback functions.This means,for instance,that JavaScript
 can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.
